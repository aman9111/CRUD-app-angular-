    <h4>
        Setup Your Environment
    </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Choose a programming language and development framework that you're comfortable with.
        </li>
        <li>
            Set up your development environment with the necessary tools, like a code editor and a database system.

    <h4>
        Design Your Data Structure
    </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Decide what kind of data your application will manage. For example, if it's a task manager, you'll have
            tasks
            with names, descriptions, and due dates
        </li>
        <li>
            Create a blueprint for how this data will be organized, like defining the fields (columns) in a table if
            you're
            using a database.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
        Create (C) - Adding Data
    </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Build a form or user interface for users to input new data (e.g., filling out a form with task details).
            Write code to save this data into your chosen storage system (e.g., a database table or a JSON file).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
        Read (R) - Displaying Data
    </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Create a page or section where users can view the data you've added.
            Write code to retrieve and display this data from your storage system.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
        Test Your Application
    </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Test your CRUD operations thoroughly to make sure they work as expected. Try adding, reading, updating, and
            deleting data.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fix any issues or bugs you encounter during testing.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
        Polish Your User Interface (UI)
    </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Make your application user-friendly by improving the design and layout.
            Ensure that users can easily navigate and interact with your CRUD features.

    </ul>
