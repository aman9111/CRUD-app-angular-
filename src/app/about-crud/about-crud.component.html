   <b> CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete, which are the four basic operations that can be performed on data in a
    database or a persistent storage system.</b>
</h4>
<ol class="aboutCrud">
    <li >
        <b>Create (C):</b> This operation involves adding new data or records to the database. It's like inserting a new row in a
        database table. For example, in a web application, it could be adding a new user, creating a new blog post, or
        inserting a new product into an e-commerce catalog.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Read (R):</b> This operation is about retrieving or reading existing data from the database. It allows you to retrieve
        one or more records based on certain criteria, such as fetching user profiles, displaying a list of blog posts, or
        searching for products in an online store.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Update (U):</b> The update operation involves modifying existing data in the database. You can use it to change
        attributes of an existing record. For instance, in a social media app, you might use this to edit your profile
        information, update a post's content, or modify a product's details.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Delete (D):</b> Delete operation, as the name suggests, is used to remove data from the database. It's about deleting
        records or entries that are no longer needed. For example, you could delete a user account, remove a blog post, or
        take a product out of the catalog.
    </li>
    <li>
        CRUD applications are fundamental in software development because they allow users and applications to interact with
        and manipulate data. These operations are at the core of most web and mobile applications, and they form the basis
        of many database-driven systems. They provide a structured way to manage and maintain data integrity within an
        application.
    </li>
   
</ol>
